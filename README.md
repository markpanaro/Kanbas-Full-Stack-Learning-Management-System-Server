## Overview
Kanbas is a clone of the popular learning management system (LMS) Canvas. This repo holds the Node server for the project. The application is publicly hosted using Netlify for the front-end, Render.com for the back-end, and MongoDB Atlas for the database. It was built using TypeScript, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN stack). The MongoDB database stores data across several collections, including users, courses, modules, and quizzes. The Mongoose library is used to define schemas and connect the Node.js server to the database. Data Access Objects (DAOs) are defined to facilitate database interactions, while RESTful APIs enable communication between the front-end and back-end. Users interact with the application through the React interface.
